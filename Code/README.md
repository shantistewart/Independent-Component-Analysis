## Code

This folder contains Python (.py) files to implement the FastICA algorithm and audio (.wav) files for algorithm
application.


### Files

* Python files:
    * main.py: _main script to load data, run FastICA algorithm, generate plots, and play audio._
    * ICA.py: _contains functions to implement FastICA algorithm._
    * plotting_functions.py: _contains functions to visualize data._

* Audio files:
    * Difficult speech:
        * hard_speech_x1.wav: _original audio file of microphone 1._
        * hard_speech_x2.wav: _original audio file of microphone 2._
        * hard_speech_s1.wav: _audio file of estimated source 1 (over-written each time that main.py is run)._
        * hard_speech_s2.wav: _audio file of estimated source 1 (over-written each time that main.py is run)._
