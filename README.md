# Independent-Component-Analysis

A class research project for Matrix Analysis for Machine Learning Signal Processing (ECE 599) at Oregon State
University. The goals of this project were the following:
1. Write a research paper about the mathematical theory and algorithms of independent component analysis (ICA).
2. Implement the FastICA algorithm and applied it to a simple audio source separation example.



## Required Python Libraries

* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib


## Repository Structure

* **Code:** _Python code to implement the FastICA algorithm._
   * main.py
   * ICA.py
   * plotting_functions.py
* **Paper:** _Research paper in pdf and Latex form._
   * Research Paper.pdf
   * **Latex:** _Latex document with template and referenced images._
