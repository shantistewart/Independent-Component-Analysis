\section{Introduction}

To motivate the topic of independent component analysis (ICA), let us consider a well-known problem in audio signal processing known as the \textit{cocktail party problem}. The setup of the problem is as follows. There is a person, a radio, and two microphones in a single room, and neither the person, radio, nor microphones are moving relative to each other. The person is talking and the radio is playing music simultaneously, and the two microphones are constantly recording. Let us denote the audio source signals of the person (speech) and the radio (music) as $ s_1(t) $ and $ s_2(t) $, and the recorded audio signals of the two microphones as $ x_1(t) $ and $ x_2(t) $. This setup is illustrated in Fig. \ref{cocktail_fig}.

According to the physics of acoustic theory, sound adds linearly: the audio signal that is recorded in a microphone or perceived in our ear drum is the linear combination of audio signals from multiple sources. In our example, the audio signal recorded at each microphone is a linear combination of the audio signals generated by the person and the radio:
\begin{equation}
x_1(t) = a_1s_1(t) + b_1s_2(t)
\label{cocktail_1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x_2(t) = a_2s_1(t) + b_2s_2(t)
\label{cocktail_2}
\end{equation}
where $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ are constants that depends on the distance from microphone $ i $ to the source. The recorded signals $ x_1(t) $ and $ x_2(t) $ are called a \textit{linear mixture} of the source signals $ s_1(t) $ and $ s_2(t) $. For the purpose of this problem, any time delays or other complicating details are ignored.

The goal of this problem is to recover the source signals $ s_1(t) $ and $ s_2(t) $ just by observing the recorded signals $ x_1(t) $ and $ x_2(t) $. If the coefficients $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ are known, then the problem is simply a system of linear equations, which can be solved quite easily. However, if the coefficients $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ are not known, the problem becomes much more difficult. This problem is an example from a topic called \textit{blind source separation (BSS)}, which encompasses all problems whose goal is to separate mixed sources using only observed data. One approach to solve a subset of BSS problems (namely, those with linear mixture models) is independent component analysis (ICA).

\section{Problem Formulation}

This section explains the framework of ICA and formulates ICA as a general optimization problem.

\subsection{Framework}

The basic setup of ICA is the following. Let $ \boldsymbol{x} $ be an $ n $-dimensional random vector of the observed data. Each sample of $ \boldsymbol{x} $ is assumed to be drawn from an unknown joint distribution $ P(\boldsymbol{x}) $. Let $ \boldsymbol{s} $ be an $ n $-dimensional random vector of $ n $ underlying source signals $ s_i $. For the purpose of this section, the number of sources is assumed to be equal to the number of observed signals -- this assumption simplifies several steps of the problem formulation.

There are two key assumptions behind the theory of ICA: 1) each source $ s_i $ is \textit{statistically independent} from the other sources and 2) the observed data is a \textit{linear mixture} of the sources. Both assumption are reasonable approximations to the underlying physical model in many cases. The linear mixture model can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{s}
\label{linear_mixture}
\end{equation}
where $ \boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is an unknown square matrix that "mixes" the sources. $ \boldsymbol{A} $ is known as the \textit{mixing matrix}. In this section, $ \boldsymbol{A} $ is assumed to be nonsingular.

The goal of ICA is to determine an \textit{unmixing} matrix $ \boldsymbol{W} \approx \boldsymbol{A^{-1}} $, which is an approximation of the inverse of $ \boldsymbol{A} $. The \textit{unmixing} matrix can then be used to estimate the sources:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\hat{s}} = \boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x} \label{source_estimation}
\end{equation}
such that $ \boldsymbol{\hat{s}} \approx \boldsymbol{s} $.

\subsection{Initial Strategy}

To solve for the \textit{unmixing} matrix $ \boldsymbol{W} $, we first decompose $ \boldsymbol{A} $ by singular value decomposition (SVD):
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\boldsymbol{V^T}
\label{A_SVD}
\end{equation}
where $ \boldsymbol{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $ \boldsymbol{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} $ are orthogonal matrices, and $ \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} $ is a diagonal matrix of singular values. Since $ \boldsymbol{A} $ is nonsingular and therefore full-rank, $ \boldsymbol{A} $ has $ n $ nonzero singular values and $ \boldsymbol{\Sigma} $ consequently is also full-rank and nonsingular. Using the SVD of $ \boldsymbol{A} $, $ \boldsymbol{W} $ can be written as:
\[
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{A^{-1}} = (
\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\boldsymbol{V^T})^{-1}
\]
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{V}\boldsymbol{\Sigma^{-1}}\boldsymbol{U^T}
\label{W_SVD}
\end{equation}
where the expression was simplified with the fact that the inverse of an orthogonal matrix is its transpose.

The \textit{unmixing} matrix $ \boldsymbol{W} $ has been decomposed into three pieces, and we can now focus on determining each of these parts separately.

\section{Methods}


\section{Application: Audio Source Separation}


\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline
copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
